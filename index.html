            <h1>ABOUT ME<span></span></h1>
             <p class="para"> Hello! My name is Ma. Nicole B. Morales. I was born on October 30, 2005, in Davao City but raised
                 in Baganga, Davao Oriental. Currently, I live in Davao City to pursue my studies and experience living 
                 independently. I’m a Computer Science student at the University of the Immaculate Conception. My favorite 
                 color is a shade close to brown, much like the color of coffee, as I’m a coffee enthusiast. I also love 
                 traveling and dream of visiting Paris someday. Ice cream is my comfort food because it gives me a sense of calm and peace.
                I’m passionate about exploring new places and constantly learning, both in life and in my academic journey.
                I really love being alone most of the time as it gives me peace and makes me calm. When I am alone, 
                I can think peacefully. However, sometimes I love being with my friends, as they also give me happiness and are my source of energy.
                Choosing Computer Science was the most unexpected decision I ever made because it wasn't part of my plan. 
                It sparked my curiosity, and I decided to take the risk. I don’t think it’s a good idea to always follow 
                our curiosity and let our impulsive thoughts win,
